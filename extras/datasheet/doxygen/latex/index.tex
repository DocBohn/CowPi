This library is designed to support the \char`\"{}\+Cow Pi\char`\"{} hardware kit to teach undergraduate students the concepts of memory-\/mapped I/O, polling, and interrupts.\hypertarget{index_hardware}{}\doxysection{Supported Hardware}\label{index_hardware}
The current version supports\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microcontrollers
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ATMega328P (Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item SPI Displays
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 8x8 LED Matrix driven by MAX7219
\item 8-\/digit 7-\/segment display driven by MAX7219
\item 2-\/row, 16-\/column HD44780\+U-\/based LCD character display, using 74HC595 as a serial interface
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item I2C (aka IIC, TWI) Displays
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 2-\/row, 16-\/column HD44780\+U-\/based LCD character display, using MCP23008 (such as the Adafruit SPI/\+I2C backpack) or using PCF8574 (such as in the myriad (nearly) identical I2C serial interfaces available from many, many sources)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4x4 matrix keypad
\item Two pushbuttons (aka tactile switches)
\item Two slide-\/switches
\end{DoxyItemize}

As a practical matter, other displays are also supported (assuming they use SPI or I2C) but there are default implementations only for those listed. Similarly, other inputs/outputs using the GPIO pins are readily used with the memory-\/mapped I/O data structures defined in the library, the default implementations assume the LEDs, switches, buttons, are attached to specific GPIO pins. While additional microcontrollers will be supported, only those listed above currently have data structures for memory-\/mapped I/O defined in the library.\hypertarget{index_license}{}\doxysection{License}\label{index_license}
