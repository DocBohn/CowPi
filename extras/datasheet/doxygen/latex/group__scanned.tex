Scans the keypad to determine which, if any, key was pressed. 

There is no debouncing. This is a portable implementation, not a memory-\/mapped implementation. Returns the ASCII representation of the character depicted on whichever key was pressed (0-\/9, A-\/D, $\ast$, \#).

Assumes a common 4x4 matrix keypad with the rows in Arduino pins D4-\/\+D7 and the columns in Arduino pins A0-\/\+A3 (D14-\/\+D17). A pressed key grounds a pulled-\/high input.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
ASCII character corresponding to the key that is pressed, or NUL if no key is pressed 
\end{DoxyReturn}
