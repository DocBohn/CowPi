# Datasheet

As with many things, the datasheet is a work-in-progress.

The datasheet combines information about the Cow Pi hardware and the CowPi library.
The hardware version can be specified through the Makefile target (`make mk1c`, `make mk1d`, or `make mk3a`).
The library information will be for the most-current version of the library (currently, v0.4) that is relevant to the specified hardware version.
