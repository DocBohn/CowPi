# Cow Pi Mark 1 Construction Instructions

We will soon place the LaTeX files for the construction instructions here.
For the moment,
[they](https://github.com/PHSI-supplements/labs/tree/main/HardwareKit/construction)
depend on some
[macros](https://github.com/PHSI-supplements/labs/tree/main/common)
in another repo, and the files that contain those macros have other macros that
wouldn't make sense to include in this repo. Once we correct that, we'll place
the LaTeX files in this repo.

Meanwhile, we've placed pdf files here for the Cow Pi mk1b, which uses the
MAX7219-based 8-digit 7-segment display module, and for the Cow Pi mk1d, which
uses the 2x16 character LCD display module with I2C adapter module.
